        <h3>
        
  Explore what's possible, in items inspired by adventure. The changing needs and temperatures of Oregon's Smith Rock led our designers to create these rugged trousers that convert to shorts with just one zip. Up top, a water-repellent wool blend helps keep you dry, warm and ready for anything.</h3>
